## Setup

The pipeline is a part of SCING (Single-Cell pIpeliNe Garden; pronounced as "sing" /si≈ã/). For setup, please refer to [this page](https://github.com/hisplan/scing). All the instructions below is given under the assumption that you have already configured SCING in your environment.

## Create Job Files

You need two files for processing a V(D)J sample - one inputs file and one labels file. Use the following example files to help you create your configuration file:

- `configs/template.inputs.json`
- `configs/template.labels.json`

### Reference

Use one of the URLs below for the reference genome:

### Multiome

If you want to process the ATAC product of the multiome using Cell Ranger ATAC v2 (i.e. without GEX), you must set the following in the job config file:

```json
